# Hey, I'm Muhammad Bilal 👋

### Flutter Developer | BSSE Student at COMSATS Wah

I build cross-platform mobile apps with Flutter, focusing on clean architecture and polished UI/UX. I use AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Gemini to work smarter, but I understand the fundamentals behind every line of code.
