# Hi there, I'm Muhammad Bilal! 👋

### 🎓 Software Engineering Student @ COMSATS Wah
I am a bachelor's student building a robust technical foundation in **Software Engineering**. My focus is on writing efficient, scalable code and solving complex problems through Object-Oriented Design and Data Structures.

While I have a strong aptitude for Requirements Engineering and Analysis, I am currently exploring **Mobile Development** and **Backend Systems** to broaden my technical expertise.

- 🔭 **I’m currently building:** A cross-platform mobile app called **"Campus Event Companion"** using Flutter & Hive.
- 💻 **Core Strength:** Java (OOP) & Data Structures.
- 🧠 **Personality:** INFJ-A (Strategic, Analytical, and Detail-Oriented).
